We also provide tracklets extracted for each video used in our paper for evaluation.
Each npz file contains: 
'start_frame' the start frame number of the tracklet 
'bbx' a list of bounding boxes of the target person in [left, top, right, bottm]
'landmark' a list of facial landmarks we detected for each face bounding boxes
